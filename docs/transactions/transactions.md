# Transactions

Financial transactions are the most important part of the system. They can be used to move any kind of assets
between accounts or to convert one type of asset to another.

Because Copernicus Gold is based on the blockchain technology the real movement of assets is performed inside of
our private blockchains. These blockchains act like a core banking system and carry out all ledger entries occurring
for the transactions (Yeah, each transaction may generate several ledger entries).

After completion the transaction has a special attribute 'hash' which represents the hash value of the linked
blockchain transaction. 

Here below, we provide a list of operations which allow to create, modify and approve transactions of different
types.
