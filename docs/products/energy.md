# Renewable Energy API

CG is a blockchain-based engine used for tokenization of energy, real-time tracking of energy consumption and production,
as well as generating a verified, immutable energy consumption / production audit trail. Energy consumption and generation
is measured in kilowatt hours or megawatt hours. CG utilizes data it receives from devices and meters.
Depending on the client’s preference, excess energy can be either tokenized into a qualifying amount of Renewable
Energy Certificats (RECs), used for carbon offset, or sold into the Grid. In this abstract, we will lay out the process
for using CG to convert excess energy into RECs.

```

* The fields **hash**, **height**, **state** have the same meaning as in [the previous request](#4-loading-recs).
* **transactions** - a list of energy transactions which are included to the REC. The fields are the same as described for
  [transactions above](#2-loading-energy-transactions-for-a-device).

Due to the fact that one REC is equal to 1 MWh, excess energy units may remain after all the qualifying green energy
transactions have been converted into RECs. To account for this unused energy, a service energy transaction is created
with "**remainder**" value of "block_id" field. These “remainder” transactions are used for further RECs issuance. Also,
you can see the "remainder" field in the last transaction used in the REC accumulation.
